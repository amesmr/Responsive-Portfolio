                    My name is Matt Ames. I have been a programmer for about 17 years. I was in the Marine Corps from 1988-1992. I have a degree in Biology from UNC that I recieved in 1995. FYI - The Biology degree that I received was broken. It never earned me a single dime.

                <p class="aboutText">
                    I have worked for the last 17 years as either a Controls Engineer or as an Embedded Firmware Engineer. As a Controls Engineer, I worked with the factory production equipment and also designed the GUIs (Graphic User Interface) that the Operators would use when they were working with the equipment. As an Embedded Firmware Engineer Iworked at a company that designed networking switches for supercomputers. The Firmware is essentially an operating system that is burned to memory on the switches. The last switch that I worked on there had a throughput of 1.56 TerraBits/second!
